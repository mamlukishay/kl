Run instructions
----------------

Hi,

I've created a runner.rb file that runs the code, which expects 2 arguments -  
source_path: The file to parse.
target_path: A path for the output file.

Both args are mendatory (Exception will be raised if one of them is missing)

Please run as follows:
ruby runner.rb [source_path] [target_path]

Thanks, Ishay
